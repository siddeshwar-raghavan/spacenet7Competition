In this challenge, I identified and tracked buildings in satellite imagery time series collected over rapidly urbanizing areas. The competition centered around a new open source dataset of Planet satellite imagery mosaics, which included 24 images (one per month) covering ~100 unique geographies. The dataset comprised over 40,000 square kilometers of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints in the imagery, totaling over 10 million individual annotations. Challenge  was to track building construction over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization.
